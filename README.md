# Evaluating-and-Stabilizing-Retrieval-Augmented-LLMs

• Enhanced RAG LLMs by integrating Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), achieving a
significant reduction in hallucinations and a 77% improvement in WEAT effect size for bias mitigation, validated through BLEU,
ROUGE-L, and cosine similarity metrics.

• Improved retrieval accuracy and contextual relevance by implementing dynamic chunking, Approximate Nearest Neighbors
(ANN), and FAISS-based hybrid similarity searches, resulting in a 65% increase in retrieval precision and stability across
diverse datasets.
